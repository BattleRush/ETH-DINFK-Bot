      "details": "<p>This burn fine-tunes Webb's trajectory after launch. The duration of the burn will depend on Ariane 5 launcher performance.</p> <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is launched on a direct path to an orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange Point (L2), but it needs to make its own mid-course thrust correction maneuvers to get there. This is by design, because if Webb gets too much thrust from the Ariane rocket, it can’t turn around to thrust back toward Earth because that would directly expose its telescope optics and structure to the Sun, overheating them and aborting the science mission before it can even begin. Therefore, Webb gets an intentional slight under-burn from the Ariane and uses its own small thrusters and on-board propellant to make up the difference.</p> <p>There will be three mid-course correction (MCC) maneuvers: MCC-1a, MCC-1b, and MCC-2. The first burn, MCC-1a, is the most important and the only other time-critical operation aside from solar array deployment during Webb’s commissioning period. </p>",

The primary mirror segments also have an additional actuator at its center that adjusts its curvature. The telescope's tertiary mirror remains stationary. The primary and secondary mirror segments will move a total of 12.5mm, in small increments, over the course of ~10 days to complete each segment's deployment. </p> <p>After all individual mirror segment deployments are completed, the detailed optical mirror alignment process begins which is about a 3 month process. In parallel, as temperatures cool enough, instrument teams will turn on their instruments and begin each instrument's commissioning process.</p> <p> Video: <a href='https://youtu.be/hET2MS1tIjA?t=2226' target='_webbYouTube'> Next Steps Explained at Press Conference </a></p> <p> Video: <a href='https://youtu.be/_2zQiWeXTg4' target='_webbYouTube'> Mirror Alignment  </a></p>  <p> Read:<a target='_readMore' href='/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html#1c'>About Webb's adjustable mirrors.</a> </p> <p> Read:<a target='_readMore' href='/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html#8'>How 18 mirrors see as one.</a> </p> <p> Read:<a target='_readMore' href='/content/about/innovations/wavefront.html'>Mirror Alignment Technology Spinoffs.</a> </p>",

      "details": "<p>A series of activities to plan and execute MCC2 - the insertion burn for Webb's L2 orbit.  MCC2 corrects any residual trajectory errors and adjusts the final L2 orbit. </p><p>The James Webb Space Telescope is launched on a direct path to an orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange Point (L2), but it needs to make its own mid-course thrust correction maneuvers to get there. This is by design, because if Webb gets too much thrust from the Ariane rocket, it can’t turn around to thrust back toward Earth because that would directly expose its telescope optics and structure to the Sun, overheating them and aborting the science mission before it can even begin. Therefore, Webb gets an intentional slight under-burn from the Ariane and uses its own small thrusters and on-board propellant to make up the difference.</p> <p>There are three mid-course correction (MCC) maneuvers: MCC-1a, MCC-1b, and MCC-2. This final burn, MCC-2, which inserts Webb into its L2 halo orbit.</p>",
